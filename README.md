# Blogging Platform

## About App
[Blogging Platform](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/) is on of my latest, most complex & advanced responsive full-stack single-page application, which supports all kinds of CRUD features, in which I have used all of my previous knowledge and skills in the field of front-end development (React, Bootstrap) and realtime database integration (Firebase, database structure & security rules).

## Blogging Platform allows you to:

- read published blogs without authentication
